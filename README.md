# tokenwiser

> Bag of, not words, but tricks!

This project contains a couple of useful "tricks" on tokens. It's a collection 
of tricks for sparse data that might be trained on a stream of data too.

# Goal 

We noticed that a lot of benchmarks relied on heavy-weight tools while they did not 
check if something more lightweight would also work. Maybe if we just apply some simple 
tricks on our tokens we won't need massive language models. 

### Roadmap 

Clean up repo.
